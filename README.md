# File Upload and Download in React Native Application

Welcome,

React Native enthusiasts! In this, we’ll explore how to implement file functionality in a React Native application using react-native-fs library.

Introduction: When building a mobile application, handling file operations such as uploading anding files is often necessary. This is especially true when building apps that require image or handling. In this blog, we focus on file download functionality using the react-native-fs library.

Prerequisites: Before diving into the implementation, it is assumed that you have a basic understanding of React Native and have set up a development environment. If you need a refresher on file uploads, check out my previous blog: “Implementing File Upload with react-native-document-picker in React Native.”
